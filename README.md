## Setup

1) Create a virtual environment (optional)
2) Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3) Ensure AWS credentials are configured via AWS CLI or environment variables.

Optional: place credentials in `config/credentials.env` and they will be loaded if present.

## Run

Basic usage:

```bash
python main.py
```

With options:

```bash
python main.py --region us-east-1 --mcp-url http://localhost:8888
```

Disable caching:

```bash
python main.py --disable-caching
```

**Note:** AWS region defaults to your configured AWS CLI region (from `~/.aws/config`)

## Usage

### Commands
- `/exit` - Exit the program
- `/tokens` - Show detailed token usage and cost statistics
- `/cache` - Show tool result cache statistics
- `/cache clear` - Clear all cached tool results
- `/summarize` - Generate AI summary and compress context (prevents context limit errors)
- `/sessions` - List all saved sessions
- `/load <session_id>` - Restore a previous session
- Type your question or request normally to interact with the AI

**New in this version:** Per-session logging means each session is stored separately in `sessions/` directory for easy management and restoration.

## Environment Variables

You can also configure via environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export MCP_URL=http://localhost:8888
export OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
export SESSION_LOG=session.log
export MAX_MCP_TOOLS=20  # Limit number of tools loaded
```

## Token Caching Details

PwnPilot Lite uses AWS Bedrock's prompt caching feature to optimize costs:

1. **System Prompt Caching**: The security assistant instructions are cached
2. **Tool Definition Caching**: All MCP tool schemas are cached
3. **Cache Duration**: Caches last for 5 minutes of inactivity
4. **Cost Savings**:
   - Cache writes: 25% more than input tokens
   - Cache reads: 90% cheaper than input tokens
   - Typical savings: 70-90% on long conversations

## Pricing Examples (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

Without caching:
- 10,000 input tokens: $0.030
- 1,000 output tokens: $0.015
- **Total: $0.045**

With caching (after initial request):
- 10,000 cached tokens: $0.003
- 1,000 output tokens: $0.015
- **Total: $0.018** (60% savings!)

## Streaming Responses

PwnPilot Lite uses AWS Bedrock's streaming API to show responses in real-time:

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Display**: Text appears character-by-character as the model generates it
2. **Tool Detection**: Automatically detects when model requests a tool mid-stream
3. **Seamless Integration**: Works with token tracking, caching, and all other features
4. **Professional UX**: Provides immediate feedback instead of waiting for full response

### Benefits

- **Immediate Feedback**: See responses start appearing in ~500ms instead of waiting 5-10 seconds
- **Better UX**: Users know the system is working immediately
- **Interruptible**: Can Ctrl+C during long responses (future enhancement)
- **Natural Feel**: Mimics human conversation patterns

### Example

```bash
user> explain how SQL injection works

🤖 SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to
interfere with database queries. It occurs when untrusted data is sent to
an interpreter as part of a command or query. Here's how it works...
[text continues streaming in real-time]
```

### When to Disable

Disable streaming if:
- You prefer seeing complete responses at once
- You're piping output to another tool
- You're debugging and want cleaner logs

```bash
python pwnpilot_lite.py --disable-streaming
```

## Tool Result Caching Details

PwnPilot Lite caches tool execution results to avoid redundant command execution:

1. **Smart Caching**: Results are cached by tool name + normalized parameters
2. **TTL Management**: Cached results expire after 5 minutes by default (configurable)
3. **Cache Key Normalization**: Same command with different argument order hits same cache
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired entries are automatically removed
5. **Success-Only Caching**: Only successful tool executions are cached

### Benefits

- **Speed**: Instant results for repeated commands
- **Cost Savings**: No need to re-run expensive scans
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces load on security tools
- **Audit Trail**: Cache hits logged in session.log

### Use Cases

Perfect for:
- Re-checking same targets during investigation
- Demonstrating scan results to team members
- Testing different AI analysis approaches on same data
- Iterative security assessments

### Cache Management

```bash
# View cache statistics
/cache

# Clear all cached results
/cache clear

# Disable caching entirely
python pwnpilot_lite.py --disable-tool-cache

# Custom TTL (10 minutes)
python pwnpilot_lite.py --tool-cache-ttl 600
```

## Guided Mode

Guided mode allows you to use PwnPilot Lite without HexStrike MCP server. Perfect for environments where you can't run MCP or prefer manual control.

### How It Works

1. **No MCP Required**: AI suggests commands but doesn't execute them
2. **You Run Commands**: Copy suggested commands and run them in your terminal
3. **Paste Results**: Paste command output back to the AI
4. **AI Analysis**: AI analyzes results and suggests next steps

### Enable Guided Mode

```bash
python main.py --guided-mode
```

### Example Session

```
user> scan example.com for open ports

🤖 I'll help you scan example.com. Here's the command to run:

Command to run: nmap -sV -sC example.com

This will perform a service version detection scan with default scripts.
Please run this command and paste the output.

user> [paste nmap output here]

Starting Nmap 7.94...
PORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION
80/tcp  open  http     Apache httpd 2.4.41
443/tcp open  ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.41

🤖 Based on the scan results, I can see ports 80 and 443 are open...
Let's check for web vulnerabilities:

Command to run: nikto -h http://example.com

user> [paste nikto output here]

[conversation continues...]
```

### Benefits

- **No Infrastructure**: No need to set up HexStrike MCP server
- **Full Control**: You approve and run every command manually
- **Flexible Environment**: Run commands anywhere you have access
- **Learning Tool**: See exactly what commands are being used

### When to Use Guided Mode

- Testing PwnPilot Lite without full setup
- Environments where MCP can't be deployed
- Learning security testing techniques
- Maximum control over command execution
- Limited tool availability on target system

## Notes

- This script currently supports Anthropic-compatible Bedrock models/profiles for tool use
- Use inference profiles when on-demand access is restricted
- The tool list can be capped with `MAX_MCP_TOOLS=20`
- Token tracking is only available for Bedrock models (not Ollama)
- Streaming responses are only available for Bedrock models (not Ollama)
- Pricing estimates are approximate and based on January 2025 rates
- All features (streaming, caching, token tracking) work seamlessly together
